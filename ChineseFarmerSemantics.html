<h2>The story</h2>

<blockquote cite = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q><em>Maybe.</em></q>
The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky.
What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
The farmer again said, <q><em>Maybe.</em></q>

The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q><em>Maybe.</em></q>
The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q><em>Maybe.</em></q>

The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<br>
<p><strong class="good">Good</strong>  and <strong class="bad">Bad</strong>  are just one perspective. Bananas are <strong class="good">Good</strong>  for monkeys, but monkeys are not <strong class="good">Good</strong>  for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
